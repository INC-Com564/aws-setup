# aws-setup

It took me a while, but I finally got through my own aws account that was already set up I had try to reset my password, but that didn't work, so i tried to create a new account but the information i gave couldn't be used on a free plan and i had to confirm the account to a paid plan, but i didn't. Instead i try to reset the root password again and now I have my buget.

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability, supporting both key-value and document data models. DynamoDB handles infrastructure management, including scaling, patching, and backups, allowing developers to focus on application development.If I have to give one key insight about DynamoDB, It would be that database is really useful for data storage, but it would be mostly be in their database, not in Dev tools
