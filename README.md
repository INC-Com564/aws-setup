# aws-setup

It took me a while, but I finally got through my own aws account that was already set up I had try to reset my password, but that didn't work, so i tried to create a new account but the information i gave couldn't be used on a free plan and i had to confirm the account to a paid plan, but i didn't. Instead i try to reset the root password again and now I have my buget.
